## Discussion:
### Data Model
notation for describing data or information consisting of three parts: structure of data, operations on data (queries and modifications), constraints on data: what can the data be and what relations are there

### Relational Data Model
Structure: table or arrays
operations: based on relational algebra
constraints:  made possible by the relation ddl like sql

### Semi-structured data model
Structure: trees or graphs
operations: usually focus on searching
constraints: given in the tags

### Basics of the relational data model
#### Structure: 2-dimensional table called a relation
* columns (attributes): relation properties
* schema: set of attributes for a relation
* rows or tuples: data (with one component for each attribute)
* domains(data type, attribute type): the range of values for an attribute
* columns' order does matter
* relation instance: all the tuples of in a relation at a given time
* **Keys of Relations**:
	* it is a constraint: key constraint
	* Key: a set of attributes for a relation 
	* and no tow tuples in a relation inst have same values in set
*  DB Schema: a set of relations (not a relational instance) | ex in class each key attribute must be present in order to have unique value for entry

### Exercise 1: 
Def of account schema: 
Accounts(acct#, type, bal) <- schema def
(23456, checking, 1000) <- tuple def (row)

For customers relation dupe account numbers/id numbers because joint accounts: in order to create a key best to blend # 

### Exercise 2: 
converting org banking schema to semi struct

<!---
<Accounts> 
	<acctNumber> 23456</acctNumber><type>savings</type>
	<balance>1000</balance>
</Accounts>
<Customers> 
	<firstName>robbie</firstName>
	 <lastName>banks </lastName> <idNo>901-222 </idNo>
	 <account>12345</account>
</Customers>
-->

### Exercise 4: 
Schema:
employee(fname, minit, ssn, bdate, address, sex , salary,. super_ssn, dno)

department(dname, dnumber, mgr_ssn, mgr_start_date)

dept_locations(dnumber., dlocation)

Datatype:
(fname: str, minit: char , ssn: int, bdate: str, address: str, sex: char, salary: int,. super_ssn: int, dno: int)

(dname: str, dnumber: int, mgr_ssn: int, mgr_start_date: str)

(dnumber: int., dlocation: str)

Tuples:
("John", 'B', "Smith", 123456789, "1965-01-09", "731 Fondren Houst, TX", 'M', 30000, 333445555, 5)

("Research", 5, 3334445555, "1988-05-22")

(1, "Houston")2

## Activity: 

### Intro to SQL
**SQL**: 
* data definition language: declaring db schemas
* data manip language: queries and mods to db

**Relations in SQL**:
* relations -> tables
* data -> tuples in the tables
* views -> relations defined by a computation, constructed but not stored
* temporary tables -> holding query results, discarded afterwards (unstored)
*
